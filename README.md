# iWeather
This is an android weather app project. The app is friendly in UI with full functionality as a basic weather app. 
# Features 
1. It contains enough basic information for weather.
2. Allow for showing weather of different cities meanwhile, just scroll left or right. 
3. Friendly UI.The messages are shown in a good readable way. And the background changes as you page through.
   To refresh the weather data, just pull to refresh.
4. Not include any annoying ads.
# Specifications
1. It only works for cities in china so far.
2. The weather data service is provided by http://www.heweather.com/ (ps: it is free but not very stable)
3. I use this service not directly but through baidu API stroe, so you should get an baidu api key to run this programme.
   To visit baidu api store, go to this link http://apistore.baidu.com/
4. Still, there is a lot to improve and innovate to make it a better weather app.
5. Develop a weather app yourself is suitable especially for new android developers(of course,after you have learned the basic skills), hope this app can be a helping hand.
